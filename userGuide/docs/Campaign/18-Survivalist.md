## FAQ / Errata

??? question "<sup>[1]</sup>Vow of Survival - How does this interact with the Commonwealth Ambition?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>If the Survivalist is a Commonwealth Member, then Vow of Survival has no effect on how much Power is earned from the Commonwealth ambition.

    If the Survivalist is not a Commonwealth Member and wins the ambition, Commonwealth Ambition has no effect. The Survivalist gets the second place power and it is not doubled.
