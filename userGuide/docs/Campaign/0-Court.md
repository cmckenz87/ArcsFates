## FAQ / Errata

??? question "Elder Broker - Is the Trade effect considered Stealing? Can it be blocked by Sworn Guardian?"
    No. This effect is not considered stealing.

??? question "Council Intrigue - How are the Crisis and When Secured effects resolved if Imperial Council is not in the Court, due to being claimed earlier?"
    Imperial Council cannot be flipped or influenced while not in the court, so the Agent on Council Intrigue must be sent elsewhere (or in the case of Crisis, returned to their owners).

??? question "Song of Freedom - Can I free a Loyal city if I don't control it?"
    No. The control requirement applies to both Loyal and Rival cities.

??? question "Song of Freedom - Can I replace a city on a flagship?"
    No. This can only replace cities on the board.
