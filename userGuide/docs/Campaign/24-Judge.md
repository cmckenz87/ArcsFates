## FAQ / Errata

??? question "The Arbiter - Does "up to their number of empty resource slots" limit only the resources you give, or all of the listed components?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>Only the resources are limited by slots. Other pieces may be given with no limit.

??? question "Judge's Chosen - How does taking actions with the Judge's ships work?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>You can build where the Judge has ships, but the building will still be damaged if someone controls the system.

    You can move the Judge's ships, using your own Loyal starports (but not the Judge's starports) to catapult them. You cannot move them along with your own ships, but as a Regent you can take Imperial ships with them, even if the Judge is an Outlaw.

    For battles, you can battle with the Judge's ships even if you have no ships in the system. If you have ships in the system, you can battle with the Judge's ships and not your own. If you battle with your own ships, you may add the Judge's ships to the attack, but do not have to. In all of these scenarios, you may use Imperial ships in the battle if you are a Regent, regardless of the Judge's status.
