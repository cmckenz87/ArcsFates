??? info "Setup details"
    1. Shuffle the 2 Rumors Spread cards (09-10) into the Court deck.
    
        [![Rumors Spread](12/piece_0_3.jpg){ width="150" }](12/piece_0_3.jpg){ data-lightbox="1" } [![Rumors Spread](12/piece_0_2.jpg){ width="150" }](12/piece_0_2.jpg){ data-lightbox="1" }
    
    2. Place the 2 True Rumor and 2 False Rumor tokens each **face down** on a different planet. You may peek at them. *(Read below for details.)*
    
    3. Add Rumors of the Haven (11) and Sharing Rumors<sup><a href="#faq1">[1]</a></sup> (12) to the rules booklet. **Explain them to everyone.**

        [![Rumors of the Haven](12/piece_0_1.jpg){ width="150" }](12/piece_0_1.jpg){ data-lightbox="1" } [![Sharing Rumors](12/piece_0_0.jpg){ width="150" }](12/piece_0_0.jpg){ data-lightbox="1" }

    *The True Rumors show the cluster and ID symbol of the Pirate Haven, which you must hide. For example, placing the "Cluster Correct" Rumor on a planet in cluster 5 and the "Symbol Correct" Rumor on a triangle planet in cluster 2 means the Haven is secret at the 5-triangle planet.*

## FAQ / Errata

??? question "<sup>[1]</sup>Sharing Rumors - Does the Agent placed by this card count as a Loyal piece?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>Yes. This means the Agent's presence enables its owner to build, and it also means the Pirate cannot declare that there are no Rival pieces in the system.
