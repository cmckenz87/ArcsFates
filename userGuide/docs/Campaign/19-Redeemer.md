## FAQ / Errata

??? question "Ire of the Keepers - Do the restrictions of taxing Loyal cities apply to non-Loyal cities if they are taxed "like" Loyal cities?"
    No. The effects apply only to cities that are actually Loyal. Treating a city "like it is Loyal" means it uses the rules associated with Loyal cities, but is still non-Loyal for other card effects.
    
    However, these limits are in place for Loyal cities even if another card such as Empath's Bond would give you permission to tax them.
