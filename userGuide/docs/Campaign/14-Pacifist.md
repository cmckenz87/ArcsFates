## FAQ / Errata

??? question "<sup>[1]</sup>Witnesses - Am I required to control witnesses when I want to catapult move them with ships, or only when I want to move them normally?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>You must control witnesses to move them through any means, including moving them along with catapulted ships.

??? question "<sup>[2]</sup>Act III Setup - All of the card numbers referenced are incorrect."
    <a id="faq2"></a>Step 1 should refer to Empathy for All (9). Step 2 should refer to Empathy for All (10). Step 3 should refer to Reconcile with the Outraged (11) and Rebuke of the Empaths (12).

??? question "<sup>[3]</sup>Reconcile with the Outraged - If I wish to Forgive the Psionic Monopoly holder without their consent, must I return a favor as well to get the Monopoly consent?"
    <a id="faq3"></a>No. Since giving the Psionic resource allows the action without the target player's consent, it also does not require their Monopoly consent. If the Monopoly is held by a player that you are not forgiving, then you do need their consent.
