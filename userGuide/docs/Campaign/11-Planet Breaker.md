## FAQ / Errata

??? question "<sup>[1]</sup>Breaking Worlds (Hammer Fragments) - How does this effect interact with Hegemon banner and Survivalist bunkers?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>Banners and Bunkers are affected by this ability just as any other buildings would be, since this is explicitly a Harm effect.

    Banners and Bunkers can still be placed on Broken Worlds, since they do not require slots.

    Breaking Worlds may target a planet that is already broken, for the purpose of taking Banners and Bunkers that were placed after it was broken previously.
