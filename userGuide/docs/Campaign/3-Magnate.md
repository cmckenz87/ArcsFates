## FAQ / Errata

??? question "Merchant League - Can a player force the transfer of this card's resources by returning favors?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>Yes. Even though these resources do not have a raid cost, they can be forced at a cost of 1 favor per resource.

??? question "Monopoly - How exactly do the resources on Monopoly interact with other effects?"
    <a id="faq2"></a>Any effect that considers the number or type of resources currently in your possession will include the resources on your Monopolies.

    Effects that would move a resource in any way will only move resources to or from a Monopoly as if it were the supply. An effect that would move a resource in your possession cannot be used on a resource in your Monopoly.

    Effects that trigger when resources are gained or lost do not consider the resources on Monopoly to be in possession of the Monopoly's owner. This means that transfering the Monopoly card does not cause either party to gain/lose resources. Another player collecting a resource from a Monopoly you own does not cause you to lose a resource. Another player spending or returning a resource such that it ends up on your Monopoly does not cause you to gain a resource.

    However, if you move a resource from your Monopoly to elsewhere in your play area, you are considered to have gained it, and if you move a card from anywhere else in your play area to your Monopoly, you are considered to have lost it.

??? question "Monopoly Consent - Does forcing the Monopoly holder's consent allow multiple resources to be transfered or only one?"
    <a id="faq3"></a>Only one. Each resource being transfered requires its own consent. The Monopoly holder may consent to some but not all resources being transfered, and as such, forcing their consent requires a favor for each occurence.

??? question "Monopoly Consent - If I return a favor to force a Monopoly holder to transfer a resource, do I need to pay an additional favor to get the Monopoly consent?"
    <a id="faq4"></a>No. By returning a favor to force the negotiate action, you also gain all of the necessary consent from the target player to carry out the action. (To force a *different* player to transfer an asset, you still need the Monopoly holder's consent.)

??? question "Act II Resolution - The instructions refer to the card Fuel Interest, which does not exist."
    <a id="faq5"></a>The card number is correct, but the name is not. This should refer to the Shipping Interest (CC04). 

??? question "Elder Broker - Is the Trade effect considered Stealing? Can it be blocked by Sworn Guardian?"
    <a id="faq1"></a>No. This effect is not considered stealing.
