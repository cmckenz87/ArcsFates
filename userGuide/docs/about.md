## About the FAQ / Errata

FAQ and errata included on this site are mostly unofficial and unconfirmed. Many of the rulings were compiled by Discord user @turmoilbyrd and some by myself. Some rulings were verified with the Leder Games team while others were decided by group consensus in the Discord channel or by our own critical reading of the rules and card text.

They are collected here in an effort to give players a neutral third-party resource to help resolve disputes. Some rulings and interactions are ambigious - if your interpretation differs, feel free to ignore our recommendations.

You may wish to view @turmoilbyrd's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaeEFwosc7JMf9ZukAFQWzB8P2yWtXJmgFInNS7rmOM/edit?usp=sharing">Standlone Rules FAQ</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaYDA6Y75VQi-bkhEsgXoy1DvWeksZ3FmqB4uByxhRk/edit?usp=sharing">Campaign Rules FAQ</a>. These include often overlooked items which are not referred to on this site as I felt the rulebook provided an adequate answer to the question already.

As and when official FAQ and Errata are published, the rulings here will be updated to reflect the official positions.
